Once apon a time there was a big W that loved to W pancakes. He would make them everyday. One day he found out there was no more W left. So he W on a journey to find some more. He met a dog, a W cat, and a W. They all told him to go to the top of the mountain of W in order to W more. So he went up the W mountain and took out his ladle to scoop some into a W. He then went back home and ate the rest of his pancakes!
