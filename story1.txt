Once apon a time there was a big N that loved to V pancakes. He would make them everyday. One day he found out there was no more N left. So he A on a journey to find some more. He met a dog, a A cat, and a N. They all told him to go to the top of the mountain of N in order to V more. So he went up the A mountain and took out his ladle to scoop some into a N. He then went back home and ate the rest of his pancakes!
